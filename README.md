# novafori-technical-task

NovaFori's technical task for Full Stack Developer

• How long did you spend on your solution?
About 6 hours, let's say my testing skills where a bit rusty.

• How do you build and run your solution?
For the backend I used Visual Studio 2022 and for the frontend I used Visual Studio Code with the integrated node terminal.

• What technical and functional assumptions did you make when implementing your solution?
I guess to use the same .NET version that the solution came with instead of updating to the latest version.
I also had to recreate the frontend project because I had some problems with some node packages.

• Explain briefly your technical design and why do you think is the best approach to this
problem.
So I wanted to keep things as simple as posible. I always try to write code simple enough so you don't need to comment every line.
I also didn't want to add a lot of external packages, so no logger or mapper.

• If you were unable to complete any user stories, outline why and how would you have liked
to implement them.
I believe I did all the stories but I didn't test the frontend because I haven't used a frontend testing tool but I would like to learn it in the future.
